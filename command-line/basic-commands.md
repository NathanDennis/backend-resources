## Linux Command Line Basics

Some of these commands are common across different operating systems and is very beneficial to familiarise yourself with

### cd
- Change your current directory
- Move within your current working directory, or specify a path to change to

Example: 

`cd ../` - move up one folder to the parent folder

`cd /usr/local` - move into the folder named 'local' inside the 'usr' directory

### ls
- List the contents of the current directory

Example:

`ls` - By itself will list the contents of the folder you are in

`ls -1` - List folder contents in a single column list

`ls` Has a lot of optional flags - [More examples here](https://www.howtogeek.com/448446/how-to-use-the-ls-command-on-linux/)
